      <li>1 cup unsalted butter softened to room temperature (226g)</li>
      <li>2 cups powdered sugar (320g)</li>

      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 Tablespoons heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350F and generously grease and flour two 8" round cake
        pans (you may instead use 9" pans, just keep in mind you will need to
        bake the cake for about 5 minutes less than indicated). Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chopped chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 30
        seconds. Stir well, and then return to microwave and heat in 15-second
        increments, stirring well in between, until chocolate is completely
        melted and smooth. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using an electric or stand mixer, cream together butter, oil, and sugar
        until light and fluffy (about 30 seconds on high speed).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Pause as
        needed to scrape down sides and bottom of bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Stir in vanilla extract.</li>
      <li>
        In a separate, medium-sized bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder,
        and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a spatula and gently hand-mixing, alternate adding flour mixture
        and buttermilk to the butter/oil batter, starting and ending with flour
        mixture and mixing until just combined after each addition. Do not
        overmix!
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour ⅓-½ of the batter into a separate bowl and add chocolate mixture.
        Stir until completely combined and batter is evenly chocolate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alternate adding vanilla and chocolate batter to each pan, evenly
        distributing batter into each pan. Use a knife to swirl for marbled
        appearance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake on 350F (175C) for 30 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in
        center comes out mostly clean but with a few moist crumbs (do not
        over-bake or the cake will be dry, you want there to be a few crumbs).
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow cake to cool for 15 minutes before carefully inverting onto
        cooling rack to cool completely before frosting.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chocolate Frosting steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave chocolate chips at 15 second
        intervals, stirring between intervals, until chips are completely
        melted. Set aside and allow to cool slightly (about 10 minutes, stirring
        occasionally).
      </li>
      <li>
        Cream room temperature butter with an electric mixer. Stir in slightly
        cooled chocolate and beat well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually add sugar, scraping down the sides and bottom of bowl
        occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>Sprinkle in salt and vanilla extract, stir well.</li>
      <li>
        Gradually add heavy cream, increase speed to high and beat for 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread a thick layer of frosting over the top of one cake round and
        sprinkle with mini chocolate chips. Top with second cake round and
        evenly frost cake. Slice and serve.
      </li>
