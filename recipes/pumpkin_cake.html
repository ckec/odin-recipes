    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      My soft, spiced, melt-in-your-mouth pumpkin cake recipe takes just 20
      minutes to prep before baking. Top it with a simple cream cheese frosting,
      and you’ve got yourself a seasonal showstopper!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter softened to room temperature (226g)</li>
      <li>1 cup granulated sugar (200g)</li>
      <li>½ cup light brown sugar firmly packed (100g)</li>
      <li>½ cup canola oil or vegetable oil (120ml)</li>
      <li>2 cups pumpkin puree* (488g)</li>
      <li>4 large eggs room temperature preferred</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>¼ cup milk (60ml)</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups flour (310g)</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons pumpkin spice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cream Cheese Frosting</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 oz cream cheese softened (225g)</li>
      <li>½ cup unsalted butter softened (113g)</li>
      <li>1 vanilla bean, scraped or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3 ½ cups powdered sugar (435g)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350F (175C) and prepare 2 8″ cake pans by lightly
        greasing and flouring the sides and lining the bottom with parchment
        paper. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine butter and sugars in the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a large
        bowl and use an electric mixer). Beat until well-combined and light and
        fluffy.
      </li>
      <li>Add oil and beat to combine.</li>
      <li>Stir in pumpkin.</li>
      <li>Add eggs one at a time, stirring well after each addition.</li>
      <li>
        Stir in milk and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and bottom of
        the bowl to ensure ingredients are evenly combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate, medium-sized bowl, whisk together dry ingredients (flour,
        baking powder, baking soda, salt, pumpkin spice, and cinnamon).
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually add dry ingredients to wet, stirring until completely combined
        (be sure to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl). I prefer to
        do this with a spatula to avoid over-mixing the batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide batter evenly into prepared cake pans and bake on 350F (175C) for
        40-45 minutes, or until centers spring back to the touch and a toothpick
        inserted in the center comes out with few moist crumbs or clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow cakes to cool for 10 minutes and then invert onto cooling rack and
        allow to cool completely before frosting.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cream Cheese Frosting</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine butter, cream cheese, vanilla extract and salt
        and beat until smooth, creamy, and well-combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually add powdered sugar to mixture until well-combined, smooth, and
        light.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once cakes have cooled, ice/assemble cakes by first leveling the cakes
        (I linked th the leveler I used in the "equipment" section above),
        generously icing between layers, applying an even layer on the top of
        the cake, and then applying a scant, semi-naked layer around the outside
        of the cake.
      </li>
    </ul>
