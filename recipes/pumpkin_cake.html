		<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>My soft, spiced, melt-in-your-mouth pumpkin cake recipe takes just 20 minutes to prep before baking. Top it with a simple cream cheese frosting, and you’ve got yourself a seasonal showstopper!</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>1 cup unsalted butter softened to room temperature (226g)</li>
				<li>1 cup granulated sugar (200g)</li>
				<li>½ cup light brown sugar firmly packed (100g)</li>
				<li>½ cup canola oil or vegetable oil (120ml)</li>
				<li>2 cups pumpkin puree* (488g)</li>
				<li>4 large eggs room temperature preferred</li>
				<li>1 Tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
				<li>¼ cup milk (60ml)</li>
				<li>2 ½ cups flour (310g)</li>
				<li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
				<li>4 teaspoons pumpkin spice</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Cream Cheese Frosting</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>8 oz cream cheese softened (225g)</li>
				<li>½ cup unsalted butter softened (113g)</li>
				<li>1 vanilla bean, scraped or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
				<li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
				<li>3 ½ cups powdered sugar (435g)</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Preheat oven to 350F (175C) and prepare 2 8″ cake pans by lightly greasing and flouring the sides and lining the bottom with parchment paper. 
				    Set aside.</li>
				<li>Combine butter and sugars in the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a large bowl and use an electric mixer). Beat until well-combined and light and fluffy.</li>
				<li>Add oil and beat to combine.</li>
				<li>Stir in pumpkin.</li>
				<li>Add eggs one at a time, stirring well after each addition.</li>
				<li>Stir in milk and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure ingredients are evenly combined.</li>
				<li>In a separate, medium-sized bowl, whisk together dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, pumpkin spice, and cinnamon).</li>
				<li>Gradually add dry ingredients to wet, stirring until completely combined (be sure to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl). I prefer to do this with a spatula to avoid over-mixing the batter.</li>
				<li>Divide batter evenly into prepared cake pans and bake on 350F (175C) for 40-45 minutes, or until centers spring back to the touch and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with few moist crumbs or clean.</li>
				<li>Allow cakes to cool for 10 minutes and then invert onto cooling rack and allow to cool completely before frosting.</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Cream Cheese Frosting</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>In a large bowl, combine butter, cream cheese, vanilla extract and salt and beat until smooth, creamy, and well-combined.</li>
				<li>Gradually add powdered sugar to mixture until well-combined, smooth, and light.</li>
				<li>Once cakes have cooled, ice/assemble cakes by first leveling the cakes (I linked th the leveler I used in the "equipment" section above), generously icing between layers, applying an even layer on the top of the cake, and then applying a scant, semi-naked layer around the outside of the cake.</li>
			</ul>
